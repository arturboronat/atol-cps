# atol-cps


# Get CPS models

- Clone viatra CPS repository: https://git.eclipse.org/r/viatra/org.eclipse.viatra.examples
- Go into the `cps` folder.
- Build and install into your local maven repository: `mvn install`. (This will take some time)

# Build ATOL example

Now with viatra CPS installed in your local m2 repository you should be able to build the project with a gradle `./gradlew installDist`.
